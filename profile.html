          <h2>Include Youth</h2>
          <p><font size="5"> Include Youth is a regional rights-based charity for young people in or leaving care, from disadvantaged communities or whose rights are not being met to improve their employability and personal development. We influence public policy in the areas of youth justice and youth employment. All our work is underpinned by the voice of children and young people, evidence-based practice and international children's rights standards. We provide direct services to young people who are not in education, employment or training through our Give &amp; Take Scheme, Meant to Work, Aiming Higher and other partnership projects. The young people we work with and for includes those from socially disadvantaged areas, those who have had poor educational experiences, those from a care background, young people who have committed or are at risk of committing crime, misusing drugs or alcohol, undertaking unsafe sexual behaviour or other harmful activities, or of being harmed themselves. </font></p>
